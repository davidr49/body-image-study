          <p class='text-center member-details1'>Hannah is a PhD student at the Centre for Psychiatry and Mental Health, Queen Mary University of London, and the Chief Investigator on the Body Image and Ethnicity study.
            At QMUL, she previously completed an MSc in Cultural and Global Perspectives in Mental Health Care (2017), and an MRes in Psychological Therapies (2019).
            Hannah’s PhD project builds on her research in body dissatisfaction prevention, cultural inclusivity and involvement to co-produce a cultural adaptation of The Body Project – a body dissatisfaction prevention programme with the most
            robust evidence base in the field.
            She also acts as an external supervisor for the MSc Eating Disorders and Clinical Nutrition course at UCL.
            Hannah has also worked in a senior role for a national mental health charity across their research, policy and practice areas, where she still consults on policy areas and facilitates qualitative research. She led on a number of key
            areas, including: children and young people’s mental health; co-production; early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services; and physical health inequalities among people with a ‘severe mental illness’ (SMI).</p>

        </p>

        <p class='text-center member-details1'>Dr Taylor trained in psychiatry in Manchester and then as a senior trainee at the Maudsley and the Institute of Psychiatry where she completed her PhD. Her PhD research was a study of factors predicting
          persistence of medically unexplained symptoms in primary care. Dr Taylor runs a liaison psychiatry clinic at the Royal London and has both a clinical and research interest in somatisation and medically unexplained symptom syndromes.
          Together with a dermatology colleague Dr Taylor has established and runs an innovative psychodermatology clinic at the Royal London Hospital. The clinic is involved in clinical research in psychodermatology particularly looking at treatment
          approaches for patients with unexplained dermopathy. Dr Taylor is co chair of the UK Association of Psychodermatology which seeks to promote understanding of the interface area between psychiatry and dermatology and improve services for
          patients, and training for staff as well as stimulating research in this field.

            Dr Una Foye </p>

          <p class='text-center member-details2'>Dr Foye started at KCL in March 2019 to join the Mental Health Nursing team at IOPPN. Her work has previously focused on understanding individuals’ experiences of living with mental health problems to
            help improve how we develop and improve services to meet the needs of those using them. This interest comes from her work in the third sector providing support services to young people with eating disorders in Northern Ireland. Dr Foye
            completed her PhD at Ulster University exploring the role of emotional intelligence in the onset and maintenance of disordered eating and has published and presented a number of papers to help develop an understanding of how we can
            utilise emotions within interventions and within recovery.
            Beyond this area of specialist interest, she has worked on numerous research studies focused on patient experience with a particular interest in inpatient mental health settings and acute medical settings. This work includes the national
            study into patient experience: EURIPIDES with Queen Mary University of London and Warwick University, and Mental Health in Acute Care Study at City University London.
            Most recently Dr Foye was awarded an LSI Centre for Mind Public Participation grant to develop a public event using comedy as a creative approach to talking about mental health and eating disorders. The event was a great success, showing
            new approaches to talking about mental health. This engagement work remains an area she's interested in and wants to further develop.
